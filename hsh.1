.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple command line interpreter that reads and executes commands either interactively from the user or non-interactively via a pipe.

.B hsh
parses the input line into command arguments. It first checks for built-in commands. If the command is not a built-in, it checks for a direct path. Finally, it searches the directories listed in the

environment variable. Found commands are executed in a child process created by
.B fork(2)
and
.B execve(2).

In interactive mode,
.B hsh
prompts the user for input with the following string:
.nf

A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell searches for executable programs.
